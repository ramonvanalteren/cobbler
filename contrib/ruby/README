ruby-cobbler
============

Ruby bindings for interacting with Cobbler.


USAGE
-----

To include the code, you must install the ruby gem named "cobbler" and then
require 'cobbler' in your application.

Minimally you need to provide a server name for your Cobbler machine using:

Cobbler::Base.hostname = my.cobbler.server

If you intend to modify data on the Cobbler server, you'll need to also provide
a username and password that has authorization:

Cobbler::Base.username = username
Cobbler::Base.password = password

CONFIGURATION
-------------

By default, Cobbler::Base will load the file config/cobbler.yml, if it exists, 
and use that information for talking to Cobbler. To override where this file
lives, set the COBBLER_ENV environment variable *before* requiring the 'cobbler'
file.
