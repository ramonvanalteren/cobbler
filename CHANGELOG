Cobbler CHANGELOG
(all entries mdehaan@redhat.com unless noted otherwise)

* Wed Oct 25 2006 - 0.3.1-1
- The app now refers to "virt" in many places instead of "xen".
  It's been coded such that files will migrate forward without
  any major issues, and the newer version of koan can still hit
  older releases (for now).  The CLI still takes the --xen options
  as well as the new --virt options, as they are aliased.  The API
  now exclusively just uses methods with "virt" in them, however.
- Fixed some bugs related to kickstart templating

* Tue Oct 24 2006 - 0.3.0-1
- Reload httpd during sync
- New profiles without set kickstarts default to /etc/cobbler/default.ks
  though this can be changed in /var/lib/cobbler/settings
- Better forward upgrades for /var/lib/cobbler/settings.  New entries
  get added when they are referenced.

* Tue Oct 24 2006 - 0.2.9-1
- Bug fix, enchant now detects if koan_path is not set
- import now can do ssh rsync as well as just rsyncd
- Misc bug fixes related to not choking on bad info
- Fixed bug where --pxe-address wasn't surfaced
- Sync is a little less verbose

* Mon Oct 16 2006 - 0.2.5-1
