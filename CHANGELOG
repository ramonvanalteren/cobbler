Cobbler CHANGELOG
(all entries mdehaan@redhat.com unless noted otherwise)

* Mon Jan 28 2007 - 0.4.0
- Placeholder

* Mon Jan 28 2007 - 0.3.9
- Make init scripts correspond with FC-E guidelines

* Thu Jan 24 2007 - 0.3.8
- Fixed minor bug in logfile processing related to 0.3.7

* Thu Jan 24 2007 - 0.3.7
- Default/examples kickstarts are now fully automatic (added hd type/size detection).
- Kickstart tracking now includes remote syslog support, just run "cobbler sync" to enable.
- "cobbler status" command improved to include syslog info/times.
- Added fc6 kickstart file that was left out of the RPM earlier
- Added mini domU kickstart
- bugfix: don't install mod_python watcher on older Apache installs (like RHEL4) as it
  somehow corrupts downloads on older copies.  kickstart tracking by syslog still works
  on those platforms.  (This only applies to the cobbler server, not clients).

* Thu Dec 21 2006 - 0.3.6
- locking feature now enabled
- "enchant" now supports provisioning virtual images remotely when using --is-virt=yes
- cobbler no longer restarts httpd if the config file already exists.
- "cobbler repo sync" is now an alias for "cobbler reposync"
- "cobbler list --something" can now be invoked as "cobbler something list"
- "cobbler list" just shows names of items now
- "cobbler report" is now used for showing full information output
- "list" (as well as report) are now sorted alphabetically
- basic kickstart tracking feature. requests on /var/www/cobbler get logged to /var/log/cobbler.

* Wed Dec 20 2006 - 0.3.5
- Fixed bug in cobbler import related to orphan detection
- Made default rsync.exclude more strict (OO langpacks and KDE translation)
- Now runs createrepo during "cobbler import" to build more correct repodata
- Added additional repo mirroring commands:  "cobbler repo add", etc
- Documentation on repo mirroring features.
- fix bug in rsync:// import code that saved distributions in the wrong path
- The --dryrun option on "cobbler sync" is now unsupported.
- Fixed bug in virt specific profile information not being used with koan
- import now takes --name in addition to --mirror-name to be more consistant
- rsync repo import shouldn't assume SSH unless no rsync:// in mirror URL
- strict host key checking disabled for "cobbler enchant" feature

* Mon Dec 05 2006 - 0.3.4
- Don't rsync PPC content or ISO's on cobbler import
- Manpage cleanup

* Tue Nov 14 2006 - 0.3.3
- During "cobbler sync" only PXE-related directories in /tftpboot
  are deleted.  This allows /tftpboot to be used for other
  purposes.

* Thr Oct 25 2006 - 0.3.2
- By default, boot and install in text mode

* Wed Oct 25 2006 - 0.3.1
- The app now refers to "virt" in many places instead of "xen".
  It's been coded such that files will migrate forward without
  any major issues, and the newer version of koan can still hit
  older releases (for now).  The CLI still takes the --xen options
  as well as the new --virt options, as they are aliased.  The API
  now exclusively just uses methods with "virt" in them, however.
- Fixed some bugs related to kickstart templating

* Tue Oct 24 2006 - 0.3.0
- Reload httpd during sync
- New profiles without set kickstarts default to /etc/cobbler/default.ks
  though this can be changed in /var/lib/cobbler/settings
- Better forward upgrades for /var/lib/cobbler/settings.  New entries
  get added when they are referenced.

* Tue Oct 24 2006 - 0.2.9
- Bug fix, enchant now detects if koan_path is not set
- import now can do ssh rsync as well as just rsyncd
- Misc bug fixes related to not choking on bad info
- Fixed bug where --pxe-address wasn't surfaced
- Sync is a little less verbose

* Wed Oct 18 2006 - 0.2.8

* Tue Oct 17 2006 - 0.2.7

* Tue Oct 17 2006 - 0.2.6
- Removing Cheetah and replacing w/ simpler templating system
- Don't delete localmirror on sync

* Mon Oct 16 2006 - 0.2.5
