<h3>Internet Relay Chat (IRC)</h3>
<p>Cobbler has a chat room on <strong><a href="http://www.freenode.net/">irc.freenode.net</a></strong> ... <strong>#cobbler</strong>:</p>

<p> If no one seems to be responding to your requests in IRC, feel free to ask your questions on the mailing list. (It's quite common for IRC users to 'idle' their nicks in a channel so they can catch up on any conversation they missed later on.)</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> irc.freenode.net has an IRC 'nick' (nickname, the name you go by in chat) registration system. Some irc.freenode.net channels require that you identify with the server every time you log in. This identification is also required for private messages on the network (no, they're not ignoring you; you probably just haven't identified with the registration system!) For more information, please consult <a href="http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#contents-userregistration">the Freenode Frequently-Asked Questions page on user registration</a>.</p>

<h3>User Submitted Content</h3>

As mentioned in the documentation section, <A HREF="http://cobbler.et.redhat.com/documentation.php">Cobbler has a Wiki</A> for user submitted content.

<h3>Bugs/Features</h3>

Bugs and Features for all distributions can be filed on the <A HREF="https://hosted.fedoraproject.org/projects/cobbler/">Cobbler</A> and <A HREF="https://hosted.fedoraproject.org/projects/koan/">Koan</A> Trac pages.  Cobbler and koan also have <A HREF="http://bugzilla.redhat.com">bugzilla</A> components if you are using Fedora and prefer to post items there.   Regardless, the mailing list and the IRC channel are very active -- so if you need help, you do not need to file a bug report unless you want to do so.
