<h2>About Cobbler</h2>

<p>Cobbler is a Linux boot server that allows for rapid setup of network installation environments.  With a simple series of commands, network installs can be configured for PXE, reinstallations, and virtualized installs using Xen or KVM.  Cobbler uses a helper program called 'Koan' (which interacts with Cobbler) for reinstallation and virtualization support.</p>

<p>Setting up Cobbler is simple.  Installation trees can be <A HREF="./cobbler-import.php">imported</A> directly from media you already have (or copied from a mirror location), and turned into network install sources within minutes.  RHEL, Fedora, and Centos are all supported for both the boot server and installation targets.</p>

<p>Cobbler can, if desired, also assist in <A HREF="./cobbler-dhcp.php">managing of DHCP infrastructure</A> for provisioned systems (using <A HREF="http://www.isc.org/sw/dhcp/">ISC dhcp</A> or <A HREF="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html">dnsmasq</A>), mirroring install trees, templating kickstart files, automatically creating PXE menus, and locally <A HREF="./cobbler-repos.php">mirroring repositories</A> used by systems on your network.  Lots of additional information on advanced features can be found on the <A HREF="https://hosted.fedoraproject.org/projects/cobbler/">Cobbler Wiki</A>.</p>

<p>In short, Cobbler helps build and maintain network installation infrastructure really easily.  It's highly customizable to your particular methods of operation through a wide variety of options, a pluggable extension mechanism, and (for developers) its own Python API.  Cobbler lets administrators forget <i>how</i> software gets installed and delivered and lets them concentrate instead on what they want to install where.</p>

<p>Whether you run a large datacenter, a campus lab, or just have a handfull of machines on a home network, cobbler can help you perform installations and updates faster.</p>
