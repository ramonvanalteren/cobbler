=head1 NAME

koan standards for 'kickstart-over-a-network' and allows for both network provisioning of new Xen guests and "auto-kickstarting" (destructive re-provisioning of any existing system).  It interacts with a centralized boot server that has been configured with 'cobbler'.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

koan --xen --server=host --profile=name

koan --replace-self --server=host --profile=name

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When invoked, koan requests profile information from a remote boot server that has been configured with cobbler.   What koan does with the profile data depends on whether it was invoked with --xen or --replace-self.

For --xen, cobbler will create new Xen domUs on a xen dom0 in accordance to the orders from cobbler.

For re-kickstarting ('--replace-self'), this means reprovisioning the system, blowing away any current data and replacing it with the results of a network install.

Consult the man page for cobbler for more information.
