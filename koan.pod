=head1 NAME

koan standards for 'kickstart-over-a-network' and allows for both network provisioning of new Xen guests and destructive re-provisioning of any existing system.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

koan --xen --server=host --profiles=[profile1,profile2,...]

koan --replace-self --server=host --profile=profile_name

=head1 DESCRIPTION

koan requests named profile information from a remote boot server, 
which has been configured with the 'cobbler' program, and acts on the data from that server.

For --xen, this means creating new Xen domU's on a xen dom0 in accordance to the orders from cobbler.

For re-kickstarting ('--replace-self'), this means reprovisioning the system, blowing away any current data and replacing it with the results of a network install.
