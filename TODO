cobbler TODO list.
now with 1-5 priority ratings

always:
2  -  better documentation (particularly online articles)
      switch (manpages) to asciidoc?

core:
5 -  "check" should check if services (esp httpd) are started
1 -  better tracking solution.  

user interface:
3 -  "cobbler add" should be distinguished from "edit" so as to not overwrite
     ex: "cobbler edit profile --name=asdf --kickstart=foo" should just change the kickstart.
5 -  GTK (or Web) UI for Cobbler ?
5 -  have -v or --version

koan items:
1 -  enable more virtualization types in koan
4  - LVM support
1  - hwvirt

code cleanup:
5 -  remove the cobbler_msg logic since i18n isn't likely

ideas:
5 -  make the multiple-bootloader system more plugin oriented to allow
     for alternative bootloaders (not neccessarily kickstart related)
     to be added.  (Low priority)
4 -  someone suggested looking at OMAPI for DHCP management
3 -  explore use cases for pykickstart "plugin" concept
5 -  mDNS discovery of server from koan
1 -  XMLRPC cobbler daemon to isolate koan from yaml parsing and allow future
     advanced features.

small bugs:
3  - no logrotate or cleanup for /var/log/cobbler (kickstart tracking)
3  - relax detection of kernel/initrd to accept any file
5  - use smaller swap dependant on ram setting.
