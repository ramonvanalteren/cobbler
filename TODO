cobbler TODO list

core:
  -  turn on locking in production (or think about it)
  -  import over http://, ftp:// in addition to existing file and rsync://
  -  make "cobbler sync" only change what needs to change, to be more efficient
     (though is this really a problem?  Copying doesn't take THAT long...)
  -  make the "scrub orphans" bit a seperate command, warn by default, with an
     option for "--delete".  Seperate from "import".   This could probably
     be a part of "check" to avoid making another command.
  -  "check" should check if services (esp httpd) are started
  -  import should be able to do rsync over ssh:// as well as rsync://

user interface:
  -  "cobbler add" should be distinguished from "edit" so as to not overwrite
  -  GTK (or Web) UI for Cobbler ?
  -  make sync have less output
  -  PXE menus would be interesting for default behavior.  
     Set local boot to the timeout default, show all profiles.
     Depends on how many entries can be added...

code cleanup:
  -  an argument parsing overhaul is probably due
  -  remove the cobbler_msg logic since i18n isn't likely

ideas:
  -  make the multiple-bootloader system more plugin oriented to allow
     for alternative bootloaders (not neccessarily kickstart related)
     to be added
