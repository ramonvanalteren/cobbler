cobbler TODO list.
now with 1-5 priority ratings

always:
2  -  better documentation (particularly online articles)

core:
1  -  re-support repo add taking http:// urls, which will use repotrack/reposync
1 -  import over http://, ftp:// in addition to existing file and rsync:// and ssh://
5 -  "check" should check if services (esp httpd) are started

user interface:
5 -  "cobbler add" should be distinguished from "edit" so as to not overwrite
5 -  GTK (or Web) UI for Cobbler ?
5 -  have -v or --version

koan items:
1 -  enable more virtualization types in koan
4  - LVM support
1  - hwvirt

code cleanup:
5 -  remove the cobbler_msg logic since i18n isn't likely

ideas:
5 -  make the multiple-bootloader system more plugin oriented to allow
     for alternative bootloaders (not neccessarily kickstart related)
     to be added.  (Low priority)
4 -  someone suggested looking at OMAPI for DHCP management
3 -  explore use cases for pykickstart "plugin" concept
5 -  mDNS discovery of server from koan
1 -  (stateless) scripts triggered on profile/system/distro add
1 -  (stateless) support for diskless object w/o dummy profile/distro

small bugs:
3  - no logrotate or cleanup for /var/log/cobbler (kickstart tracking)
3  - add warning if kernel arg length is exceeded
3  - relax detection of kernel/initrd to accept any file
