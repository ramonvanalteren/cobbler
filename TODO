- HIGH PRIORITY:
- Test interfaces in CLI and webapp thoroughly
- make authz_ownership work for all of the new commands (require admin group?)
- make logging cleaner for cobbler exceptions (CX) , don't show a traceback, just print

- MODERATE PRIORITY:
- See that --clobber, (DONE) --in-place, --delete-interface and other odd fields still work.
- Look over old webapp and ensure tooltips in new version are good enough or better
- Look for missing fields in CLI/webapp
- Replicate improvements
- yum SHA knowledge for F12 from older OS (reposync/import)
