cobbler TODO list
  -  GTK (or Web) UI for Cobbler ?
  -  Port over to xeninst python module once available for something other than Rawhide
  -  Wake on lan integration for PXE
  -  Integration with stonnith or other up/down devices?
  -  Locking
  -  For "enchant", try to verify that syslinux and mkinitrd are installed on the remote.    
  -  "make test" shouldn't overwrite files in /var/lib/cobbler/ 
  -  "enchant" would be better if it didn't need to know the password
  -  "enchant" has issues with ssh key changes locking it out
  -  "enchant" should be written in a more distro-agnostic way.
  -  "add" should be distinguished from "edit" so as to not overwrite
     new configs.
   
general cleanup:
  -  an argument parsing overhaul is probably due
  -  remove the cobbler_msg logic since i18n isn't likely
