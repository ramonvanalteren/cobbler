- HIGH PRIORITY:
- Add field type, CSS type, and choices to FIELDS structures for all object types
- Make webapp use get_fields logic and make it work for all pages, no more generic templates
- Make deletes and renames work in the web app, test
- Test interfaces in CLI and webapp thoroughly
- Reinstitute is_valid functions for all object saves (name required, fields consistent, etc)

- MODERATE PRIORITY:
- Make snippets and ksfiles work as pseudo collections so we can generalize the web pages for them
- Finish network objects or push to 2.2
- See that --clobber, --in-place, --delete-interface and other odd fields still work.
- Look over old webapp and ensure tooltips in new version are good enough or better
- Look for missing fields in CLI/webapp
- Gut functionality for customizable columns in web app or see that a UI is build for it and settings are added proprely.

- FUTURE:
- Console management ideas
- API to clear logs
