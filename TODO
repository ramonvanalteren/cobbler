- HIGH PRIORITY:
- Test interfaces in CLI and webapp thoroughly
- make authz_ownership work for all of the new commands (require admin group?)

- MODERATE PRIORITY:
- Look over old webapp and ensure tooltips in new version are good enough or better
- Look for missing fields in CLI/webapp
- Replicate improvements
- yum SHA knowledge for F12 from older OS (reposync/import)
- dhcp.conf config path default change for F11 (F12?)
- reinstate reports with formatted output options
- automatically generated tabs for webapp (virt parameters on different page, etc)
