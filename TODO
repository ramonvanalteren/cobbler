bootconf TODO list

   - Implement Xen tree creation / write xen-net-install
D  - Unified options and nomenclature for Xen.
D  - Group is a "Profile", not a Group
   - Bootconf 'trace' command to show what a system would be provisioned to
T  - Do kernel copying into directories named after each distro
     to resolve name conflicts
I  - Manpage (in progress) .. continuously...
  -  Pulling the kernel and initrd from the kickstart information
     distro add [--kickstart] optionally as alternative to
     [--kernel=] and [--initrd=].  If so, groups can INHERIT kickstart info
     from the group (can and must if the distro has a kickstart specified).
  -  Don't require root, check for permissions on dirpaths we touch.  (Run pieces of check modularly when we start)
  -  openuri checking for kickstart existance (HTTP HEAD)
  -  Support pxelinux's default directory and impl. Xen defaults
  -  Subnet creation shorthand
  -  MAC ranges for Xen (how best to do this?)
  -  Consider some sort of kickstart manager to templatize kickstarts?
     
LEGEND

T = DONE. SOME TESTING STILL TBA.
D = DONE. LOOKS FINE.
P = PARTIAL
I = IN PROGRESS
