bootconf TODO list

IMPORTANT ITEMS

T  - Do kernel copying into directories named after each distro
     to resolve name conflicts
I  - Manpage (in progress) .. continuously...
T  - Optional kernel parameter input to replace defaults
     show what kernel file is *currently* picked as latest.
     on a per system, group, or distro basis.  Priority
     resolved to give precendence to system, then group, then
     distro, then defaults.
     PARTIAL: input allowed and serialized but *NOT USED YET*

NICE TO HAVE

T -  Move program writeable section of config to /var 
     to conform with FS rules
D -  Make list show resolved values as currently set
     for things like initrd, kernel, kickstart
     rather than just the directories or partial filenames.
  -  Try pulling the kernel and initrd from the kickstart information?

RANDOM IDEAS
  
  -  Support pxelinux's default directory
  -  Subnet creation shorthand

LEGEND

T = DONE. SOME TESTING STILL TBA.
D = DONE. LOOKS FINE.
P = PARTIAL
I = IN PROGRESS
