bootconf TODO list

T  - Implement Xen tree creation / write xen-net-install
   - Bootconf 'trace' command to show what a system would be provisioned to
I  - Manpage (in progress) .. continuously...
  -  Pulling the kernel and initrd from the kickstart information
     distro add [--kickstart] optionally as alternative to
     [--kernel=] and [--initrd=].  If so, groups can inherit kickstart info
     from the group (can and must if the distro has a kickstart specified).
  -  Don't require root, check for permissions on dirpaths we touch.  
  -  Support pxelinux's default directory
  -  Subnet creation shorthand ... (system objects that match multiples?)
  -  MAC ranges for Xen (how best to do this? shelve this for now).
  -  If there is a parse error in /etc/cobbler.conf and the user
     deletes that file, fix the bug that also deletes the file in /var.
     
LEGEND

T = DONE. SOME TESTING STILL TBA.
P = PARTIAL
I = IN PROGRESS
