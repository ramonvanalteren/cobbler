bootconf TODO list

T  - Do kernel copying into directories named after each distro
     to resolve name conflicts
I  - Manpage (in progress) .. continuously...
T  - Optional kernel parameter input to replace defaults
     show what kernel file is *currently* picked as latest.
     on a per system, group, or distro basis.  Priority
     resolved to give precendence to system, then group, then
     distro, then defaults.
T -  Move program writeable section of config to /var 
     to conform with FS rules
D -  Make list show resolved values as currently set
     for things like initrd, kernel, kickstart
     rather than just the directories or partial filenames.
  -  Try pulling the kernel and initrd from the kickstart information
     distro add [--kickstart] optionally as alternative to
     [--kernel=] and [--initrd=].  If so, groups can INHERIT kickstart info
     from the group (can and must if the distro has a kickstart specified).
  -  Support xen-netboot idea from ET meeting (manage Apache tree, add conf file)
  -  Seperate commands for checkpxe and checkxen
  -  Don't require root, check for permissions on dirpaths we touch.  (Run pieces of check modularly when we start)
  -  openuri checking for kickstart existance
  -  In general, modularilize check code as various pieces of the code need to run various pieces of it interactively and otherwise based on current state.  Should be fairly abstract.  "Check PXE", "Check Perms", "Etc".
  -  Sync runs checkpxe and checkxen based on presense of pxe/xen pieces
  -  Don't require dhcp, only that the box is the next-server. ("--nodhcp") 
  -  Support pxelinux's default directory
  -  Subnet creation shorthand
  -  ...
  -  customized kickstart for dom0 ... allow domU to get profiles
     en masse, this may evolve to be more highly dynamic as we start
     to deal with Xen migrations

LEGEND

T = DONE. SOME TESTING STILL TBA.
D = DONE. LOOKS FINE.
P = PARTIAL
I = IN PROGRESS
