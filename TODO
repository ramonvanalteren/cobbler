cobbler TODO list

  -  Subnet creation shorthand ... (system objects that match multiples?)
  -  MAC ranges for Xen (how best to do this? shelve this for now).
  -  SELinux means we want tftp files in /tftpboot and HTTP files in /var/www/something.
     May need to be chcon aware, maybe not.  Some files will be duplicated because of this.
  -  Web UI for Cobbler ?
  -  Port over to xeninst python module once available for something other than Rawhide
