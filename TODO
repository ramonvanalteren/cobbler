cobbler TODO list
  -  GTK (or Web) UI for Cobbler ?
  -  Port over to xeninst python module once available for something other than Rawhide
  -  Wake on lan integration for PXE
  -  Integration with stonnith or other up/down devices?
  -  Locking
  -  For "enchant", try to verify that syslinux and mkinitrd are installed on the remote.
