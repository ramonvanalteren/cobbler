- HIGH PRIORITY:
- Test interfaces in CLI and webapp thoroughly
- make authz_ownership work for all of the new commands (require admin group?)
- verify duplicate hostname and ip code works
- nicer error message if no permission on web.ss or cobblerd is down

- MODERATE PRIORITY:
- Look over old webapp and ensure tooltips in new version are good enough or better
- Replicate improvements
- reinstate reports with formatted output options
