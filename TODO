cobbler TODO list

core:
  -  turn on locking in production
  -  "enchant" feature needs some modifications:
      - verify that syslinux and mkinitrd are installed on the remote.
      - issues with ssh key changes locking it out (known_hosts)
      - should be written in a more distro-agnostic way.
  -  Port over to xeninst python module once available for something other than Rawhide
  -  import over http://, ftp:// in addition to existing file and rsync://

user interface:
  -  "cobbler add" should be distinguished from "edit" so as to not overwrite
  -  GTK (or Web) UI for Cobbler ?

code cleanup:
  -  an argument parsing overhaul is probably due
  -  remove the cobbler_msg logic since i18n isn't likely

ideas:
  -  make the multiple-bootloader system more plugin oriented to allow
     for alternative bootloaders (not neccessarily kickstart related)
     to be added
  -  look into what it would take to make kickstart *more optional*
     (for future support of foreign operating systems that might
      do their own thing)
  -  Wake on lan integration for PXE
  -  Integration with other remote power options (how might this work?)
  -  when creating a system definition generate the ssh key.
