Description: Install server
 Cobbler is a network install server. Cobbler supports PXE, virtualized installs, and
 reinstalling existing Linux machines. The last two modes use a helper tool, 'koan', 
 that integrates with cobbler. Cobbler's advanced features include importing 
 distributions from DVDs and rsync mirrors, kickstart templating, integrated yum
 mirroring, and built-in DHCP/DNS Management. Cobbler has a Python and XMLRPC API 
 for integration with other applications. There is also a web interface.
