Cobbler NEWS
(all entries mdehaan@redhat.com unless noted otherwise)

0.3.4 contains a /etc/rsync.exclude file that minimizes
the amount of files transferred during a cobbler import.  By
default, PPC, ISO, and debug content are not transferred
from "cobbler import" commands.  Users can customize this
file.  Imports will now use less bandwidth and take up
less disk space.
