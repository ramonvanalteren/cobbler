0.1.2

New PXE features

Cobbler now contains an experimental dhcpd.conf templating feature.
Read the manpage, and if you want to use it, back up your existing
dhcpd.conf before enabling that feature.  It is off by default.

When using that feature, dhcpd.conf can associate MAC addresses
with hostnames (as defined from cobbler), and cobbler can
also differentiate between IA64 and x86/x86_64 network boots.
