** New dhcp.conf templating and IA64 PXE features **

Cobbler now contains an experimental dhcpd.conf templating feature.
Read the manpage, and if you want to use it, back up your existing
dhcpd.conf before enabling that feature.  It is *OFF* by default.

When using that feature, dhcpd.conf can associate MAC addresses
with hostnames (as defined from cobbler), and cobbler can
also differentiate between IA64 and x86/x86_64 network boots.  Each
time cobbler sync is run, it will build a new dhcpd.conf based on
/etc/cobbler/dhcpd.template.

Cobbler is now packaging ELILO to enable IA64 booting.

Since I do *NOT* currently have access to an IA64 machine, IA64 PXE support
is largely untested, therefore there may be some issues with the way
elilo's *.conf files are formatted in /tftpboot after running a "cobbler sync".
Bug reports and patches from IA64 users are greatly appreciated.
