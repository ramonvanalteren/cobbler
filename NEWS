0.3.5 contains a more strict rsync.excludes file and now
runs createrepo after import to build more correct repodata
based on the results of that file. In addition some bugs were
fixed in the import code.  New experimental commands for
generalized repo mirroring are now in cobbler, though they
are not yet documented.

0.3.4 contains a /etc/rsync.exclude file that minimizes
the amount of files transferred during a cobbler import.  By
default, PPC, ISO, and debug content are not transferred
from "cobbler import" commands.  Users can customize this
file.  Imports will now use less bandwidth and take up
less disk space.
