0.2.7 -- RHEL4, pexpect not required, "enchant" changes
======================================================

Cobbler now builds on RHEL4 out of the box!

In order to make Cobbler work on more platforms, the dependancy on
pexpect (a python module) has been removed.  SSH is now invoked directly.
This means Cobbler now builds very easily on RHEL 4.

As a result, this means that to run "enchant" a remote system, that
system needs to have the cobbler server in the /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
file or the password will be prompted for multiple times.  Use ssh-agent
if this is undesirable.

In addition, the arguments to "enchant" have changed to make it more
flexible.  See the manpage for details.

===================================
0.2.6 -- Cheetah no longer required
===================================

Cobbler is losing it's dependency on Cheetah for kickstart templating.
Most users won't be affected, templating still works as described in the
manpage.  A future release will remove the dependancy on pxssh, allowing
for better installation on RHEL4.

=============================
0.2.5 -- New "import" feature
=============================

Cobbler now contains an import command.  It currently can
work in either of two modes (see manpage) -- filesystem directory
trees and rsync:// mirrors.

Rsync mirror support enables near instanteous setup of a new provisioning
environment by auto-importing distribution and profile information for
automatic installation.

The "enchant" command has been slightly modified in terms of what
arguments it requires.  See the manpage if you have been using
that command.

===============================
0.2.2 -- IA64 PXE Go For Launch
===============================

Having had the time to do proper IA64 testing with elilo, Itanium
PXE support is now confirmed to work.  --pxe-arch and --pxe-address
must both be set on the IA64 system when it is created with cobbler.

Additional bugfixes have improved stability of the dhcpd.conf generation.

==============================
0.2.1 -- New "enchant" feature
==============================

Usage of "enchant" can install a profile on a remote system, even
if that system does not have the koan helper tool installed.
You'll need an IP or system name, a profile name, and the password
to the system.  See the manpage.

=======================================================
0.2.0 -- New dhcp.conf templating and IA64 PXE features
=======================================================

Cobbler now contains an experimental dhcpd.conf templating feature.
Read the manpage, and if you want to use it, back up your existing
dhcpd.conf before enabling that feature.  It is *OFF* by default.

When using that feature, dhcpd.conf can associate MAC addresses
with hostnames (as defined from cobbler), and cobbler can
also differentiate between IA64 and x86/x86_64 network boots.  Each
time cobbler sync is run, it will build a new dhcpd.conf based on
/etc/cobbler/dhcpd.template.

Cobbler is now packaging ELILO to enable IA64 booting.
